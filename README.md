# React + TypeScript + Vite

## This app was developed to learn some libs and concepts about the React+TS ecosystem.

### What I learned:

- Using CSS-in-JS with **Styled Components**
- Setting up **themes and their types** for Styled Components
- Setting up **ESLint** with custom rules
- **React Router DOM** for managing app routes
- **Route Layout** and **Outlet Component**
- **Controlled** VS **Uncontrolled** concepts about managing form state
- **React Hook Form** lib for managing forms
- **Zod** for validating data schemas in RHF
- Providing correct type to forms from Zod schema (**zod.infer**)
- **useEffect** hook to deal with side-effects inside components
- ~~Prop-drilling~~
- **useContext** hook to share state between components and/or routes
- **useReducer** hook to manage complex component state (dispatch an action to change state)
- **useCallback** hook to cache functions between re-renders

**Development time:** about 3 weeks\
**Previous React understanding:** very little (I've developed a basic todo list before this)
